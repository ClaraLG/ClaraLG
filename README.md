### Hey! 🙋🏻‍♀️

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of the main programming languages: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, XML.
- 🧠 I'm excited to learn more about JavaScript Frameworks and libraries, specially Three.js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the front-end for a new project.
- 📫 Contact: you can send me a message on Linkedin -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/clara-garnes-garc%C3%ADa-1a555b157/
- ⚡ Fun fact: my interest on programming started when I had to code a website for a university assignment. I'had never heard of HTML and CSS before and our teachers didn't even explained what a "div" was. So I had the worse time trying to figure out how everything worked on my own. But I'm pretty stubborn and I need to understand how things work always, soooo here I am now, completely in love with those languages that gave me such a hard time.
